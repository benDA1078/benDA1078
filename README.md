- 👋 Hi, I’m Julian or better known as J.  
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a Data Analysis
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R Programming as I have already have moderate knowledge of Excel, but decided to continue that education into programming as I find that career area interesting for my time worth
  All of the learning are being taught by Google's Coursera course and also basic YouTube videos. Always had an interest in programming sense High School and College, however went down a bad path and life tragedies causing me to slack and losing such potential. Slowly rising back up to continue the skill that I onced loved and turn it into an career. 
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Mentor's or perhaps other programmer who can provide insight on this
